# I created these scripts & tools to make my life easier
# You are free to reuse or modify these scripts

# All this script does is fetch the release archive from Wordpress.org and extract the latest release from there

wp_release_archive='https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/'

# This script uses html2text.py from https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text
html2text.py $wp_release_archive | grep 'VersionDownload' -A 2 | grep -v 'VersionDownload' | grep -v '\-\-' | awk 'NF' | head -n 1
