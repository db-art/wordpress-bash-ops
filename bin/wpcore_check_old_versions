# This script scans the docroot_dir for vhosts that have installed wordpress. Then checks every one of them
# and see if the they all have installed the latest downloaded version of Wordpress.

source /etc/wp_ops.cfg

# See which versions we have downloaded in the core directory, sort them and then take the latest (and greatest)
latest=`ls -d $core_dir/*/ | grep -v 'latest' | sort | tail -n 1 |cut -d "-" -f 2 | cut -d "/" -f 1`

# Scan through the docroot for Wordpress installations and return a list of version.php files
vhost_versions=`find $docroot_dir -wholename "*$docroot_append/wp-includes/version.php" | grep -v $core_dir`

for version_file in $vhost_versions; do
  installed_version=`grep -h 'wp_version =' $version_file | sed -e "s/.*'\([^']*\)';/\1/"`
  if [ $installed_version !=  $latest ]; then
    echo "Detected an older version installed in: $version_file ($installed_version)"
